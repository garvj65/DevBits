# DevBits

This project demonstrates the use of industry-standard DevOps tools for version control, containerization, microservices management, code quality analysis, and build automation.

---

## 1️⃣ Git Version Control

**Objective:**  
Perform version control on websites or software projects using **Git** through both **command line** and **GUI/browser interfaces**.

**Key Tasks:**
- Initialize and manage **Git repositories**.
- Use **push** and **pull** commands to synchronize local changes with remote repositories.
- Perform version control operations using platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket** via browser.
- Learn basic Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

## 2️⃣ Docker Basics and Containerization

**Objective:**  
Install **Docker** and explore its fundamental containerization concepts by working with OS images and Docker Hub.

**Key Tasks:**
- Install **Docker Desktop**.
- Explore **Docker CLI** commands (`docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`).
- Pull and run containers using various operating system images (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine).
- Build custom Docker images and **push** them to **Docker Hub**.
- Understand container lifecycle and management.

## 3️⃣ Microservices with Docker and Docker Compose

**Objective:**  
Design, deploy, and manage a **microservices architecture** locally using **Docker Compose**.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create multi-container applications using `docker-compose.yml`.
- Define and orchestrate services (e.g., web app, database, backend services).
- Learn inter-service communication in Docker networks.
- Start, stop, and scale services using **Docker Compose**.

## 4️⃣ SonarQube and Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

**Objective:**  
Integrate **SonarQube** for static code analysis within a **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline**.

**Key Tasks:**
- Install and configure **SonarQube** on the local machine.
- Set up **Jenkins** with required plugins (SonarQube Scanner, Git integration).
- Create **Jenkins pipelines** for build automation.
- Integrate **SonarQube** within Jenkins pipeline to perform static code analysis on code commits.

---

## 5️⃣ Maven Project Management

**Objective:**  
Understand the **Apache Maven** build automation tool and manage Java project dependencies.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create a **Maven Java Project**.
- Understand and configure the **POM.xml** file.
- Add dependencies and plugins via Maven Central Repository.
- Compile, build, and package the Java application using **Maven** lifecycle commands (`mvn compile`, `mvn package`).

---

## 6️⃣ Migrating to Gradle Build System

**Objective:**  
Build and run a Java application using **Maven** and migrate the project to **Gradle**.

**Key Tasks:**
- Run Java applications with **Maven** (`mvn install`, `mvn spring-boot:run`).
- Understand the **Gradle build structure** (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`).
- Migrate the project by rewriting **build scripts** for **Gradle**.
- Build and run the application using Gradle commands (`gradle build`, `gradle run`).
